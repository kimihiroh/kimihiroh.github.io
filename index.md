## About
I am a 1st year master student, Master of Language Technologies, at [Language Technologies Institutes](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). My current research focus is event in text, specifically Event & Argument Extraction, Event Sequencing and Event Coreference. During my undergrad, I worked on a research of language generation, especially question generation.
